# DSRWay
Responding to analysis and communication: DS the R way

You have heard about R and would like to learn and see what it does and how it works? Then you should come to our workshop. Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of R and you will get to know how to use its tools needed in a typical data science project. We will introduce you to graphical and numerical techniques for exploring the information concealed within a dataset. We will use ‘dplyr’ package to carry out data manipulation with R in an intuitive to write and easy to read manner, especially when using the “chaining” syntax of pipes. Through the use of ‘ggplot2’ we will learn how to create graphs to visualise distributions, relationships and model fits. After we develop an understanding of our data we will use R’s interactive approach in telling our data story by creating reproducible R-Markdown documents and Shiny Web Apps. 

There are three sections:

- Part I: Fundamentals of Data Analysis and introduction to R through the use of 'dplyr' and 'ggplot2' packages.

- Part II: Use of R’s interactive approach in telling your data story by creating reproducible R-Markdown documents and Shiny Web Apps.
